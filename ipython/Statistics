How to Learn Statistics for Data Science As A Self Starter

Basics Stats
--------------------------------
Probability
1. Introduction to Basic Terms----
2. Variables----
3. Random Variables-----
4. Population,Sample,Population Mean,------
   Sample Mean----
5. Population Distribution, Sample Distribution -----
   and Sampling Distribution
6. Mean, Median ,Mode-------
7. Range-----
8. Measure Of Dispersion------
9. Variance-----
10.Standard Deviation------
11.Gaussian/Normal Distribution------

Intermediate Stats
--------------------------------------

12. Standard Normal Distribution  ----- when the means =0 and standard deviation =1 

13. Z score--  When you have multiple samples and want to describe the standard deviation of those sample means (the standard error), 
you would use this z score formula:
z = (x – μ) / (σ / √n)
This z-score will tell you how many standard errors there are between the sample mean and the population mean.

14. Probability Density Function : 
15. Cumulative distribution function: 


16. Hypothesis Testing
17. Many different plotting graphs
18. Kernel Density Estimation
19. Central Limit Theorem--------------- means follow the Gaussian distribution in the data set 

20. Skewness of Data
    Covariance : find the relation between the data with to -ve to +ve value 
	
    Pearson Correlation Coefficient: it is type cofficiant the should ly between the -1 to 1  , higher the +ve value greater the relation between the x and y
	
    Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient:
	
    Importance of Correlation:
	
    Hypothesis Testing
    Null Hypothesis 
    Alternative Hypothesis
    Understanding Hypothesis testing
    (T-test,Chi square test, p values)
	
	chi-square -- it is non parametric test it is performed on the categorical values it should be ordinal and nominal data 
	
	t-TEST- It is parametric test it is performed on the continous value data
